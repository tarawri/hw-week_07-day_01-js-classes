# HW JS Classes

Suppose that we wanted to create a simple program ('RunTracker') that helps people prepare for running a 5k. Each day that a person runs, they create a record of their run.

The program stores information about the user 
- the user's name
- the user's email address 

The program stores information about each run

- the date and time of the run
- the distance covered, in meters
- the time taken, in seconds

The program can perform some actions
- add run
- compute total distance run
- compute longest distance run so far 
- compute average speed (speed = totalDist / totalTime) 

## Create a Class

The goal should be to have a class that can be used like below:
```js


/////
const runner = new RunTracker("Mike", "mike@mike.com");

runner.addRun("2017-01-01", 10, 30)
runner.addRun("2017-01-02", 5, 20)

runner.totalDistance() // 50 meters

runner.longestDistance() // 30 meters

runner.averageSpeed() // 0.3 meters per second
```



## Challenge
- try using `.reduce` for `total distance run` and `average speed`
